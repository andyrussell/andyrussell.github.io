A paper that I played a minor role in has recently been published in Nature. I worked with the brilliant Luke Harvey, and I just want to thank IÃ±igo Martincorena and especially Raheleh Rahbari for involving me in such a cool publication - you can read it [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03477-4)
