excerpt: 'Single-cell multiomics technologies typically measure multiple types of molecule from the same individual cell, enabling more profound biological insight than can be inferred by analyzing each molecular layer from separate cells. These single-cell multiomics technologies can reveal cellular heterogeneity at multiple molecular layers within a population of cells and reveal how this variation is coupled or uncoupled between the captured omic layers. The data sets generated by these techniques have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of the key biological processes and mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity and how they are linked with normal development and aging as well as disease etiology. This review details both established and novel single-cell mono- and multiomics technologies and considers their limitations, applications, and likely future developments.'
