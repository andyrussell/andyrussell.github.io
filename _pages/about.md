I am a final-year PhD student at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, UK. My PhD studies were supervised by Prof. Thierry Voet, Prof. Oliver Billker, and Dr. Mara Lawniczak, and have largely focussed on applying scRNA-seq to malaria parasites to gain novel insights into gene function, gene evolution, and gametocytogenesis. 

I am currently seeking post-doctoral positions with an interest in developing multiomic single-cell technologies. Eventually, I hope to apply these technologies to normal development, as well as disease states such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease and cancer.
