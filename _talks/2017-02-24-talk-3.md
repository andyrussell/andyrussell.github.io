Drop-seq is a novel droplet microfluidic technology that is capable of sequencing the transcriptome of thousands of single cells in a single run, increasing the throughput by 2 orders of magnitude compared to many FACS or micromanipulation based methods. This allows single-cell analysis at a fraction of the cost that previous methods such as Fluidigm C1 autoprep permitted (~ 10p/cell). Developments in this technology at the Sanger Institute to date will be presented along with its application to generating single-cell transcriptomic data from malaria-causing <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites.
